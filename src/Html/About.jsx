                    Our company aims to ease not only the commute of students and workers, but also the burden of jeepney drivers in adapting to our fast-paced modernized world. This company started with the goal of helping as much people as we possibly can. The founders noticing that students, especially those in college, struggle to commute to their homes starting at 7 PM. This is because 7 PM is also the time where most of the jeepney drivers stop accepting passengers in preparation of going to their own homes. So the founders thought of a solution that will alleviate this problem. The solution is to hire jeepney drivers as services using modern jeepney that the company will purchase. The company will take a cut in the jeepney drivers nothly service salary to pay for the jeepney cost so it can be eventually sold to the jeepney drivers. Outside of service schedule, jeepney drivers are able to utilize the modernized jeepneys as public transportation. The company will take a 10% cut on the porfit that the jeepney driver will make, but the maintenance and gas cost of the jeepney will be covered by the company.
